# ProjectTwoWhiteboard

[Whiteboard Studio](https://whiteboardstudio.herokuapp.com/)

We created an online whiteboard, which can be used by multiple people in realtime. 
Boards can be downloaded so you can enjoy them anytime!

NPM's used: sequelize, express, body-parser, mysql2, socket.io

New Technologies: socket.io, flexbox, p5.js, html canvas, addthis.com

You can start drawing at any time. Open the menu to create a new studio, or find an existing one. Click the menu button, or press “m” to open the menu.

Use the color blocks at the bottom of the screen to choose your colors, or use numbers to select more colors.

1 = black
2 = white
3 = red
4 = green
5 = blue
6 = yellow
7 = cyan
8 = magenta
9 = purple
0 = orange

Use the up and down arrow keys to make the pen size bigger or smaller.

Resizing the page will erase your drawing.

Boards can be shared on social media using the buttons in the menu.

Boards can be made Public or Private. Clicking Private will create a unique code that can be used to find that specific page.

Have fun drawing!
